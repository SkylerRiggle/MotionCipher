If neither of the above options work for you, feel free to download the source code directly! To run the source code, you will need to do the following:

- Ensure that you have Python 11 or newer installed on your machine.
- Clone the repository's main branch.
- Navigate into the repository's root folder using the terminal.
- Run ```pip install PACKAGE_NAME``` for the following Python packages:
    - cv2
    - mediapipe
- Once complete, you should be able to run the main.py file by entering ```python3 ./main.py```
